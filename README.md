# README-Generator

README Generator using Node.JS

## Description

This application was created to familiarize myself with backend technologies such as Node and the inquirer package to go along with it. This would be useful for any up and coming developer as it would serve as a guide for generating a quality README for future project.

## Installation

This project is only accessible via your CLI. To access, please clone the repository, direct yourself to the location that the repository is housed, and then run 'node index.js' to use. To view your newly generated README, open the file housed in the "generated-readme" folder.

## Usage

When using the application, you should see something similar to the screenshot below. The screenshot shows the questions that the program will ask the user, as well as example answers that are suitable for generating the SVG logo. If you're not seeing something similar when you use the application, please email me at TinaTheDev91@gmail.com.
